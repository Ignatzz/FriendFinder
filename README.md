#Intro

Hello! 

Friend Finder is a mock dating application. It has the user fill out a 10 question survery with agree/disagree answers that they can answer with a number from 1 to 5. The application compares their answers to an array of stored user answers, and runs javascript to find another user with similar answers. 

The app is deployed on heroku at the following URL:
	https://afternoon-falls-79993.herokuapp.com/

All one needs to do to use it is navigate to that url, click to start the survey, click on answers to fill it out, and hit the ol' submit button!
